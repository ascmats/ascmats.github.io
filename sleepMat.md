# Are you a tester for TrampleTek Sleep (name still TBD)?
If not, you're in the wrong place!

## If you would like to join the beta test please join the ASC Discord ([invite link](https://discord.gg/cB9P6NmYJg)) and email Raymond@asc.com

## These are the step-by-step instructions to install the TT-Sleep Beta algorithm:

- Open a browser tab with the [Easy Model Installation](https://ascmats.github.io/EasyModeInstall.html) because you'll be using the "connect" button below and then following the Easy Mode Installation right at the "The below pop-up" step.

- Note that ESP Web tools only work with Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

- Click the button labeled "Connect" right below this line to start the ESP Web tool:
<esp-web-install-button manifest="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ASCKing9/TrampleTek-Blue-code/refs/heads/main/TrampleTek_Debug/SleepMatBeta/TrampleTek_Sleep.json" install-supported="">
        <i slot="unsupported">
          The option is not available because your browser does not support Web
          Serial. Open this page in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge instead<span class="not-supported-i hidden">
            (but not on your iOS device)</span>.
        </i>
</esp-web-install-button>

- Now follow the [Easy Model Installation](https://ascmats.github.io/EasyModeInstall.html) instructions. You'll know you've installed the TT-Sleep code because you'll see the name of the firmware in the install menus - **"TrampleTek Sleep Firmware"**.

## Next Steps
If this worked, great! If not, ask in the Discord for help or email me directly at Raymond@asc.com.
