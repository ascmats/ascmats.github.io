# Requirements

## Installing and running Home Assistant

For TrampleTek Blue to integrate into [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) you will need a device that runs Home Assistant.

The most common ways to setup a device are using a Raspberry Pi, an old PC, or using a tool called Docker. [Crosstalk Solutions](https://youtu.be/Y38qRYYAwAI?si=7VIHOpIk-dSyXmOQ) has a great video explaining all three of these options.

## Installing ESPHome on Home Assistant

Once you get Home Assistant running you will need to add the [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) add-on into Home Assistant. The ESPHome install is pretty simple, search for ESPHome add-on in the Home Assistant -> settings -> Add-ons -> Add-on Store. The offical ESPHome startup guide is pretty good to, find it [here](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_hassio).

## Next Steps

Now with Home Assistant and ESPHome installed and ready, we can start loading up the firmware into the TrampleTek Blue mat.
