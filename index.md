# Welcome to the documentation for TrampleTek Blue (Home Assistant version)!

<img src="images/mat_usage_image.png" width="600">

This documentation will help you through the hardware setup for Home Assistant and through some troubleshooting if things don't go quite as smoothly as expected.

## If you're here to install your mat into Home Assistant, let's get started by checking to make sure you have the [Requirements](https://ascmats.github.io/requirements.html) ready.

## If you want to revert your mat back to the original TrampleTek Blue (Bluetooth socket version) go [here](https://ascmats.github.io/TTB_restore.html).

### Please join the [ASC Discord server](https://discord.gg/cB9P6NmYJg) if you have issues, questions, or suggestions for the documentation.

You can also reach out to hello@asc.com for additional questions about ASC.

Link to the github repo for these web page is [here](https://github.com/ascmats/ascmats.github.io).
